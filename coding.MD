### Coding
1. Programming
2. Scripting

### Concepts
* Variables
* Data types --> it has no preference in scripting
* Conditions
* Loops
* Functions
* Reuse --> don't write again and again same thing

### variables
DRY --> dont repeat yourself
there is a central location where you name the variable and provide value.
